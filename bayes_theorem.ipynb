    "Suppose a company produces light bulbs and has two factories, A and B. Factory A produces 60% of the bulbs, while factory B produces the remaining 40%. Of the bulbs produced by factory A, 95% are of good quality, while only 80% of the bulbs produced by factory B are of good quality. A customer buys a bulb at random and finds that it is of good quality. What is the probability that the bulb came from factory A?\n",
